# CLEAN NEST

## Table of Contents




## Overview

Clean Nest is two-way market place that aims to be the leading provider of household cleaning services in Australia.

Clean Nest allows identity-verified cleaners to select the dates and times that they are available for cleaning (and at a later stage, the locations in which they are willing to travel to), as well as set their own hourly rate. The platform also allows customers to search cleaners by availability (and later, price and location preference) and book their services. While the cleaners and customers can communicate via a messaging system, both the booking and payment process is handled by Clean Nest. Finally, both cleaners and customers can review each other upon completion of a booking.

## Business Problem

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that the number of households in Australia is projected to increase around 50% from 2011 until 2036, and that the net worth of households will continue to grow, particularly with respect to households with a net worth of more than $1.5 million (CPI adjusted). Similarly, despite relatively high labor costs in Australia, research firm IbisWorld predicts significant growth in the household cleaning market due to the aging and growing Australian population, increasing number of households, and greater disposable income.

Currently, the household cleaning market in Australia is dominated by agencies and small business owners, many of which do not offer an online booking platform. For the booking platforms that do exist, they are run by specific agencies and are not designed for individual cleaners, which means that individual cleaners (or those looking for casual work such as students) are required to sign up with an agency before they are able to offer their services, and are unable to dictate their own hourly rate.

The agency is given full control over which cleaner they send for each booking, and takes a significant amount of the fee (estimated to be around 40%). From the customer's perspective, there is no transparency over which cleaner they are provided with, as there is no peer-review or star rating system. Even platforms like Helpling[helpling.com.au], which do allow you to view cleaner profiles, only allow you to do so if you select the option of having a regular cleaner.

They are required to trust the agency, who has its own agenda (such as sending over whichever cleaner is most readily available, rather than one who is the most appropriate for the job).

Clean Nest will offer a platform that provides greater access, transparency and accountability between cleaners and customers.



## Business Solution

which offers insurance

damaged to goods, broken or stolen tools and also on the job injuries

## Business Potential

In 2014-2015, the residential cleaning service industry had a market size of around $711 million, and it is forecast to continue growing steadily over the next five years, with revenue rising at an annualized 1.7% to reach around $900m in 2019-20.


Main benefits include:
User ratings of the house or locations cleaned
User ratings of the cleaners
Ability for part time or entrepreneurs to get in contact with jobs
Ability for quick part time jobs to locate a pool of qualified cleaners
Insurance and guarantees (id identification GPS Check ins)

Main challenges
Creating a large enough supply pool (addressed by the 8% commission rate covered below)
Creating awareness
Large Agencies



In addition, Clean Nest is able to provide identify checked as well as be insured for public liability, which is very limited in the solo cleaning market in apps such as air tasker or Craigslist.  


Financials

Pricing
Similar to Uber and AirBnb we have decided to use a fix percentage of the service pricing as a fee. A fixed dollar amount fee and percentage was considered, but in that scenario it promoted longer hours of cleaning over shorter jobs. We did not want to promote any type of cleaning over another as such a fixed percentage fee was decided upon.

An 8% fee was decided after carefully investigating the business and market. On average a cleaner will earn $20.00 - $22.00 per hour (payscale research). Most cleaning services on average will charge $25.00-45.00 per hour, as such even with charging only $25 an hour and with 8% commission the cleaner will be earning $23.00 which is more than the average cleaner rate. This will also encourage more cleaners to use Clean Nest as a platform and to provide a high-quality service which will allow them to increase their rates which in turn directly increase their earnings.

Projections

Projections are based on initial market penetration of only the Residential cleaning services.
In Europe a similar program was started and in the first 3 months of launch there were over 10,000 jobs registered and completed through the site. As such we believe it would be safe to assume to target 1% of the residential cleaning market in the first year of launch. This would project a turnover of AUS$ 7.1m in the first year. At an 8% commission rate, leading to Clean Nest earning a revenue of AUS $568k.

Below is the projection of growth of Clean Nest over the next 5 years.
It is assumed for simplicity that growth is linear in the next 5 years. In most Shared Economy adoptions, there is an accelerated rate of adoption once a threshold of 1000 stable users have been achieved. (FT times)

Base Case: hitting 1% of the residential cleaning market in the first year, then growing at around 2% a year. This is 0.3% faster than the estimated market growth by IbisWorld. This is with the assumption that Clean Nest is a niche online platform which is targeted directly at the 2 areas which is growing this market, dual high income and aging households.
Optimistic Case: Shows us growing faster than the market, at 2.5%. We see Clean Nest as a market leader and with the growth of on demand service similar to Uber and AirBnb adoption of the platform will be faster.
Slow case: Looks at the scenario if we are unable to achieve 1% market penetration in year one, and we are only able to grow at market rate of 1.7% a year. Even at this rate, we project revenues of over $450k in the first year.  



Costs to the business
Average insurance cost is $65 per month for domestic cleaning services (for a business)
The coverage includes damaged to goods, broken or stolen tools and also on the job injuries.

Other costs include marketing and advertisements, hosting of the site and services. As such costing would be considered minimal.
